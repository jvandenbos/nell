# Hyphenation patterns

The pattern files beside this one come from the TeX hyph-utf8 project
(https://github.com/hyphenation/tex-hyphen, patterns/txt/), unchanged.
Nell applies them with its own implementation of Liang's algorithm
(src/hyphenator.cpp). Each file's copyright and licence, copied from the
header of its TeX source, follows.

==========================================

ushyphmax.tex -- patterns for more hyphenation pattern memory (12000+).
Also known as ushyphen.max.

Needs extended pattern memory.
Hyphenation trie becomes 7283 with 377 ops.

These patterns are based on the Hyphenation Exception Log
published in TUGboat, Volume 10 (1989), No. 3, pp. 337-341,
and a large number of incorrectly hyphenated words not yet published.
If added to Liang's before the closing bracket } of \patterns,
the patterns run errorfree as far as known at this moment.

These patterns find all admissible hyphens of the words in
the Exception Log.  ushyph2.tex is a smaller set.

Please send bugs or suggestions to tex-live (at) tug.org.

2005-05-30 (karl): in the past, ushyphmax.tex was a file containing
only the additional patterns, without the \patterns command, etc.
This turned out not to be very useful, since in practice the TeX
distributions need one self-contained file for a language.  Therefore,
ushyphmax.tex now contains both the additional patterns from
Dr. Kuiken, and the original patterns and hyphenations from Knuth's
hyphen.tex.

The Plain TeX hyphenation tables.

==========================================
This file has been renamed from ukhyphen.tex to hyph-en-gb.tex in June 2008
for consistency with other files with hyphenation patterns in hyph-utf8 package.
No other changes made. See http://www.hyphenation.org/tex for more details.

Created by Dominik Wujastyk and Graham Toal using Frank Liang's PATGEN 1.0.
Like the US patterns, these UK patterns correctly hyphenate about 90% of
the words in the input list, and produce no hyphens not in the list
(see TeXbook pp. 451--2).

These patterns are based on a file of 114925 British-hyphenated words
generously made available to Dominik Wujastyk by Oxford University Press.
This list of words is copyright to the OUP and may not be redistributed.
The hyphenation break points in the words in the abovementioned file is
also copyright to the OUP.

We are very grateful to Oxford University Press for allowing us to use
their list of hyphenated words to produce the following TeX hyphenation
patterns.  This file of hyphenation patterns may be freely distributed.

These patterns require a value of about 14000 for TeX's pattern memory size.

        Hyphenation patterns for Dutch in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings.
        These patterns don't handle cases like 'menuutje' > 'menu-tje',
        and don't hyphenate words that have different hyphenations according
        to their meaning.
known_bugs:
    xi-ii: 'when we’d expect xiii for a roman number (see GitHub issue #29)'
==========================================
PURPOSE: 8-bit hyphenation patterns for TeX based upon the new Dutch
         spelling, officially since 1 August 1996. These patterns follow
         the new hyphenation rules in the ‘Woordenlijst Nederlandse
         Taal, SDU Uitgevers, Den Haag 1995’ (the so called ‘Groene
         Boekje’) described in section 5.2 (Het afbreekteken).

         The main differences with our earlier patterns based upon the
         CELEX dictionary are:
          (1) provide 8-bit patterns based upon the T1 character encoding
              (the encoding for DC/EC compatible TeX fonts)
          (2) don’t hyphenate if this results in a syllable of one letter
              before or after the hyphen (hence hyphens in a-drenaline,
              studi-o, mensa-pen and vide-oachtig are invalid)
          (3) handle words derived from other languages (‘bastaard
              woorden’) according to the new rules

         Like the CELEX patterns these patterns don’t hyphenate:
          (4) in a changing syllable (menuutje can not be hyphenated as
              menu-tje)
          (5) in words that have different hyphenations according to
              there meaning (buur-tje/buurt-je)
